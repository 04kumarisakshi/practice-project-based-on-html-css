    <h2>Chadwick Aaron Boseman</h2>
    <h2>1993–2020</h2>
</div>
    <p>Chadwick Boseman, in full Chadwick Aaron Boseman, (born November 29, 1976, Anderson, South Carolina, U.S.—died August 28, 2020, Los Angeles, California), American actor and playwright who became a highly respected movie star with several iconic roles, notably that of T’Challa/Black Panther in the groundbreaking film Black Panther (2018).
        Boseman was the youngest of three children. His father worked for an agricultural conglomerate and did upholstery work on the side, and his mother was a nurse. He played basketball as a high-school student, but when a teammate was shot and killed, Boseman responded by writing a play and found that he felt called to become a storyteller. After graduating from high school in 1995, he studied directing at Howard University (B.F.A., 2000). While a student there, he took (1998) acting classes in a summer program of the British American Drama Academy at the University of Oxford and visited Ghana.</p>
    <p>In 2016 Boseman played Thoth in the critically panned Gods of Egypt and starred in the little-seen revenge thriller Message from the King. However, his most notable film that year was Captain America: Civil War, in which he first appeared as Marvel superhero T’Challa/Black Panther, king of the fictional African country Wakanda who has an alter ego. Boseman next portrayed a young Thurgood Marshall as an NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) lawyer in Marshall (2017). Boseman reprised the role of T’Challa in Ryan Coogler’s blockbuster Black Panther, and his performance cemented his status as a first-rank movie star. In addition, Black Panther made news as the first big-budget movie with an almost all-Black cast, and T’Challa became a highly celebrated icon. Boseman played the character again in Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019) before starring in the police thriller 21 Bridges (2019). In 2020 he portrayed a revered fallen squad leader in Spike Lee’s Da 5 Bloods, centring on the Vietnam War.

    <h3>21 BRIDGES (2019)</h3>
    <p>Boseman was tapped by “Captain America: Civil War” directors the Russo Brothers to star in this film about an NYPD detective who shuts down the 21 bridges leading into Manhattan in order to catch two cop killers. The movie is a middling action thriller, but Boseman proved he had the potential to be an action star outside of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

   <h3>BLACK PANTHER (2018)</h3>
    <p>There is no question that Boseman’s most iconic role is that of T’Challa, aka Black Panther.

   <h3> 42 (2013)</h3>
        <p>Boseman’s first major starring role was as Jackie Robinson in this film about the life of the African-American baseball legend. Though the movie itself is a largely by-the-numbers biopic, Boseman proves his mettle both as a charismatic leading man and as a talented actor, giving a performance that was praised by Robinson’s widow for its authenticity.</p>

    <h3> MA RAINEY’S BLACK BOTTOM (2020)</h3>
        <p>In this adaptation of August Wilson’s play, Boseman plays Levee, an ambitious and overconfident trumpet player in the band led by blues legend Ma Rainey (Viola Davis). Boseman delivers one of his most interesting performances in what would be his last film, imbuing Levee with a manic energy and a quiet desperation.</p>
